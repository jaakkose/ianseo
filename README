Using htaccess with Ianseo enabling ScoreKeeper use.

Initial version. No guarantees!
Some icon bugs currently but does not prevent use.

Strongly recommend placing htaccess passwd file outside of public_html directory if possible. Passwd file generators can be found on-line.

TODO:
- Verify graphics works
- Verify flags works
- Possiblity limiting access more to ISK directory
- Verify TV output

Change log:
- Added exclusion for TV output !UNVERIFIED!
